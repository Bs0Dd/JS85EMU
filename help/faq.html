<h3>Frequently asked questions (FAQ)</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> How to use the microcomputer? Can not understand anything!<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> Read the <a href="http://mk.bs0dd.net/mk85/mk85man.pdf" target="_blank"><b>manual</b></a> for the MK 85,
    it explains the principles of operation of the device software and provides examples of BASIC programs.
    Unfortunately, there is only a Russian version of the manual, which makes it difficult for foreign users to understand.
    The translation of images does not provide 100% accuracy, so for simplicity,
    you can also study the manual of the "prototype" device - <a href="http://mk.bs0dd.net/mk85/fX700p.pdf"><b>Casio FX-700P</b></a>.
    Although the MK85 has additional commands and some differences in the operation of existing ones,
    most of the MK85 documentation is clearly borrowed from the FX-700P documentation.

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the microcomputer show that 0 bytes of memory are free, although no programs have been loaded into it?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> You probably created a new RAM image, but it was not initialized (recording initial settings),
    which is usually done by default if the "Auto init" option is selected. For manual initialization, just press the "initial settings" key.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the number on the seven-segment indicators look distorted in WRT mode?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> If the microcomputer has more than 9999 bytes of free space,
    the firmware cannot adequately display the number. Use the free BASIC memory indicator on the options panel.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does ERR6 always occur when trying to access a variable via a number (for example A(3) instead of D)?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> Apparently, 32KB of RAM was chosen for the microcomputer. Unfortunately, the factory ROM starts to work incorrectly with such a large size,
    but the emulator has a fix ("32KB fix") that solves this problem (at the cost of losing only 2 bytes of free memory).
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why in a BASIC program, when trying to return from a subroutine (RETURN), does an incomprehensible error occur in a non-existent line?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> It seems that the subroutine have the LETC command, which, unfortunately, corrupts the return stack (firmware bug),
    so it is impossible to return from the subroutine after it. You will have to change the program structure without LETC in the subroutines.
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Why does the microcomputer turn off (both real and virtual) if I press the STOP key 21 times?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> The STOP key, when pressed, always causes a switching to HALT mode and execution of a HALT interrupt.
    For this reason, apparently, there are no handler for this key in the system for detecting the pressed key.
    This system has a counter that counts the number of unsuccessful attempts to identify a key (resets upon the first successful identification).
    Since the STOP key is considered "unknown", then after 21 presses (and, accordingly, 21 "failed" attempts to identify the key),
    the firmware believes that strange things are happening with the microcomputer and sends a signal to turn it off.
    In the emulator, as in the real device, a software switch is implemented (only in the virtual microcomputer, after operation,
    for convenience, the power switch is automatically flipped), so the device turns off.

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> What is "PL ROM" and what is it for?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> This is a modified version of factory ROM created by Piotr Piątek (version 27 BETA from 17.11.2010).
    The firmware contains a number of innovations, including new BASIC commands,
    expansion of the functionality of existing ones and support for data exchange interfaces
    (although they require hardware modification, so they are not supported in the emulator).
    More details about this firmware can be found on the
    archive version of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150828094341/http://mk85.republika.pl/rom.html" target="_blank"><b>site</b></a> (Polish language).
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> What about emulation of MK 85B (85Б) and MK 85C models?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> In 2024, Dmitry Shtatnov read the ROM of the portable encryptor "Ancript", also known as Elektronika MK-85C.
    A special emulator version was developed for it - <a href="https://github.com/Bs0Dd/JS85cEMU" target="_blank"><b>JS85cEMU</b></a>.
    It also has support for an experimental configuration for emulating the banking version of the encryptor - MK-85Б.
    However, to avoid potential problems, the firmware for version Б cannot be published at the moment and is only available to a limited number of people.
</p><br>

<p style="text-align: left;">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Q:</b> Is it possible in the future to emulate a prototype version of MK 85?<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>A:</b> Unfortunately, due to the slightly different design of the prototype,
    even if a dump of the prototype firmware appears on the network, the emulator most likely will not be able to work normally with it.
    Some minor reworking of some emulator components may be required.
